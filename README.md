> **🤖 Collaborative AI + Human Chat for Obsidian**
>
> A persistent chat panel where **AI agents and humans participate as equals** — across devices, in real time. Agents can read and edit your vault through native tool calling. Bring your own API keys. Your data stays in your vault.

---

## ✨ What It Does

Obsidian AI adds a **persistent chat panel** to your Obsidian sidebar. Unlike typical chat plugins, it treats **AI agents and remote humans as equal participants** in the same conversation. Everyone broadcasts to everyone. Each participant decides whether and how to respond.

**Key idea:** You can have a chat tab with:
- Just you and an AI agent
- You + multiple AI agents
- You + remote humans (via WebSocket relay) — with or without AI agents present
- Any mix of the above

Messages are tagged with the sender's identity. You always know who said what — whether it's a local AI agent, a remote user on another device, or yourself.

The AI can also **directly manipulate your vault** through structured tool calls — search notes, edit content, create files, move documents, and more — all from the conversation.

---

## 🚀 Features

### Collaborative Chat (AI + Human Peers)

The core of Obsidian AI is a **multi-participant chat** where everyone is a first-class citizen:

- **Equal-Footing Participant Model** — AI agents, remote humans, and the local user all broadcast messages to each other. No special orchestrator hierarchy.
- **Message Attribution** — Every message shows who sent it: local user ("You"), an AI agent (with colored dot), or a remote human (with their device/user ID).
- **Participant List Bar** — Persistent bar below the chat header showing all active participants: selected AI agents and connected remote users, each with a colored status dot.
- **Typing Indicators** — See when remote users or agents are typing ("Alice is typing…" with animated dots). Auto-clears after 3 seconds.
- **Multi-Agent Panel** — Select which AI profiles participate via checkbox dropdown. Each agent sees the full conversation context.
- **Mention Routing** — `@Cloudy fetch arxiv` sends that request only to the agent named Cloudy.
- **Zen Mode** — Hide all chrome, see only messages and input.
- **Mobile-Responsive** — Works on tablet and phone layouts.

### Multi-Device Sync (WebSocket Relay)

Continue the same chat across multiple devices — laptop, tablet, phone:

- **Real-Time Sync** — Messages sync instantly between devices via WebSocket relay.
- **Human-Only Chat** — Chat with other humans without any AI agents present. Pure peer-to-peer messaging.
- **Mixed Chat** — Have both AI agents and remote humans in the same tab. Agents see human messages; humans see agent responses.
- **Self-Hosted Relay** — Run the relay on your own machine or VPS; no third-party servers.
- **LAN Discovery** — Auto-detect your local IP for easy same-network setup.
- **Zero Persistence** — Relay is stateless; no messages stored on the server.

See [Multi-User Chat Design](memory-bank/implementation/multi-user-chat-design.md) for architecture details.

### Agentic Note Editing (13 Tools)

The AI can directly manage your vault through structured tool calls:

| Tool | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| `read_note` | Read any note's full content |
| `edit_note` | Overwrite a note with new content |
| `append_to_note` | Add content to the end of a note |
| `create_note` | Create a new note in any folder |
| `patch_note` | Find-and-replace inside a note |
| `edit_section` | Rewrite content under a specific heading |
| `search_notes` | Search by filename or path |
| `list_notes` | Browse folders with subfolder support |
| `get_note_metadata` | File stats (size, dates, word count) |
| `create_folder` | Create new folders |
| `move_note` | Move or rename notes |
| `delete_note` | Delete notes (to system trash) |
| `list_folders` | Navigate vault structure |

**Approval Flow**: By default, every tool call shows a preview card in chat — you approve or reject before it executes. Toggle **Auto-Apply** (🤖) to skip approval for trusted workflows.

**Smart Results**: Tool outputs are formatted as markdown tables and lists before the AI sees them — no raw JSON dumps in your chat.

### Inline AI Editing

- **Context-Aware Suggestions** — Highlight text or place your cursor, press `Ctrl/Cmd + K`, and get AI-powered transformations.
- **Visual Diff Preview** — See exactly what changed with inline markers for additions and deletions before you commit.
- **One-Click Apply / Discard** — Accept changes instantly or dismiss them without touching your note.
- **Custom Slash Commands** — Define your own system prompts and trigger them with `/` shortcuts.

### Vault-Aware Context

- **`@mention` Notes** — Reference any note in chat.
- **Folder & Tag Context** — Attach folders or tags (returns file listings, not full contents — no token bloat).
- **Active Note** — Include the note you're currently editing.
- **Embed Expansion** — `![[...]]` embeds resolved recursively up to depth 2.

### Web Search

Ask about recent events or facts beyond the model's training data:

- **5 Providers**: DuckDuckGo (free), Brave Search API, Tavily, Exa, SearXNG (self-hosted).
- **No extra setup** for DuckDuckGo — works immediately.
- **API keys** for Brave, Tavily, Exa entered in Settings.

### Multi-Provider Support

Bring your own keys. No data leaves your machine unless you choose it to.

| Provider | Models | Local / Cloud |
|---|---|---|
| **OpenAI** | GPT-4o, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 | Cloud |
| **Anthropic** | Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3 Opus | Cloud |
| **Google** | Gemini 1.5 Pro, Gemini Flash | Cloud |
| **DeepSeek** | DeepSeek V3, DeepSeek R1 | Cloud |
| **OpenRouter** | 200+ models via unified endpoint | Cloud |
| **Ollama** | Llama, Mistral, Qwen, and more | **Local** |
| **Azure OpenAI** | Enterprise GPT models | Cloud |
| **Custom** | Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint | Either |

- **Per-Provider Profiles** — Save multiple configurations and switch between them.
- **Model Discovery** — Fetch available models from your provider automatically.
- **Mid-Session Switching** — Change profile without starting a new chat.

### Streaming & Quality-of-Life

- **Streaming Responses** — See output appear in real time.
- **Token Usage Indicator** — Visual feedback on context budget (green → amber → red).
- **Session History** — Conversations saved and restored across restarts.
- **Archive & Rename** — Organize past chats, auto-name sessions.
- **Abort** — Cancel streaming mid-generation.
- **Retry** — Regenerate a response with one click.

### Debug & Diagnostics

- **Diagnostics Panel** — Memory usage, DOM nodes, chat sessions, total messages.
- **File-Based Logger** — Debug logs written to disk for troubleshooting.
- **Error Boundary** — Catches React render crashes, shows fallback UI.
- **Build Info in Settings** — Version badge, git commit hash, and branch name visible in Settings hero.

## 📦 Installation

### Via BRAT (Recommended for Beta Users)

The fastest way to install and get automatic updates:

1. Install the [**BRAT**](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat) plugin from Community Plugins
2. Open **BRAT Settings** → **Add Beta plugin**
3. Paste: `https://github.com/space-cadet/obsidian-ai`
4. Click **Add Plugin** — BRAT will install the latest release and auto-update

### Manual Installation

1. Download the latest release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/space-cadet/obsidian-ai/releases)
2. Extract `main.js`, `styles.css`, and `manifest.json`
3. Copy them to your vault: `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-ai/`
4. Enable in **Settings** → **Community Plugins`

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

### 1. Open the Chat Panel

Click the **💬** icon in the left ribbon (or run **"Open Obsidian AI Chat"** from the Command Palette).

### 2. Configure Your Provider

Open **Settings** → **Obsidian AI** → **Provider Profiles**.

Click **Add Profile**, choose your provider, and enter:
- **API Key** (if required)
- **Model** — type a name or click **Fetch Models** to discover
- **Custom URL** (for Ollama or custom endpoints)

### 3. Chat with AI Agents

1. Select which AI profiles participate via the **👥** participant button
2. Type a message — all selected agents see it and can respond
3. Use `@AgentName` to route a message to a specific agent
4. Toggle **Zen Mode** (🧘) to hide all chrome

### 4. Chat with Remote Humans

1. **Start the relay** on one device (or a server):
   ```bash
   pnpm run relay
   # or
   node relay/relay-server.js
   ```
2. **Note the IP** — The relay logs the listening address (e.g., `ws://192.168.1.42:8080`)
3. **Connect other devices** — In each device's **Settings** → **Sync**, enter the relay URL and a room ID
4. **Open the chat** on all devices — Messages sync in real time, with attribution showing who sent each message

You can have AI agents and remote humans in the same tab, or humans only.

### 5. Edit Notes from Chat

When the AI generates content you want to keep:

- Click **Apply → Note** to diff-merge the response into the active note
- Click **Create Note** to save it as a new file
- Click **Append → Note** to add it to the end of an existing file

Or use slash commands in your message:
- `/create [[Note Name]]` — create a new note
- `/edit [[Note Name]]` — overwrite an existing note
- `/append [[Note Name]]` — append to an existing note

### 6. Agentic Tools

Ask the AI to manage your vault directly:

> "Summarize my `[[Project Notes]]` and create a draft in `Drafts/`"

The AI will:
1. Read `Project Notes` via `read_note`
2. Generate a summary
3. Create the draft via `create_note` — pending your approval (unless Auto-Apply is on)

### 7. Inline Editing (Optional)

1. Select text in any note (or place your cursor)
2. Press `Ctrl/Cmd + K` (customizable in Hotkeys)
3. Type your instruction — e.g. *"make this more concise"* or *"translate to Spanish"*
4. Review the diff preview
5. Click **✓ Accept** to apply, or **✗ Discard** to cancel

### 8. Web Search (Optional)

Open **Settings** → **Web Search**. Choose a provider (DuckDuckGo works without setup). Now you can ask:

> "What happened in quantum gravity research this week?"

## 📱 Mobile Notes

Obsidian AI works on mobile (iOS/Android), but there are platform-specific behaviors to be aware of:

### Background Execution

When the Obsidian app is moved to the background, the operating system suspends its webview to preserve battery. This means:

- **LLM streams pause** — Any in-progress response stops streaming and may fail
- **Tool calls abort** — Pending vault operations (create, edit, move) will not complete
- **Network requests cancel** — Any API calls in flight will be interrupted
- **Timers freeze** — JavaScript intervals and timeouts stop

**What persists:** Your chat history, session state, and context items are saved to local storage aggressively. When you return to the app, the conversation resumes exactly where you left it.

**Recommendation:** For long-running operations (large document analysis, multi-step tool workflows), keep the Obsidian app in the foreground. Use the **Abort** button if you need to pause mid-stream.

### Mobile-Responsive UI

The chat interface adapts to smaller screens:
- **Horizontal scrolling** for the action bar on narrow viewports
- **Auto-expanding textarea** for the input field
- **Compact icon buttons** to maximize message space
- **Zen mode** (hide all chrome) via the header toggle
